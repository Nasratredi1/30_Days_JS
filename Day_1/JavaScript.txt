The following are JavaScript primitive data types:String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null, and Symbol.
Booleans
A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.

A boolean data type is either a true or false value.

Example:

true // if the light is on, the value is true
false // if the light is off, the value is false


Null and Undefined Difference.
In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

Ex :
let firstName
console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet

Null
Null in JavaScript means an empty value.

let emptyValue = null

If we want to cheack the type of the variable we used 
Typeof Operator.  like below 

console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string
console.log(typeof 5) // number
console.log(typeof true) // boolean
console.log(typeof null) // object type
console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined


Commentint in JavaScript
 
// Used For single Line Comment 
/* */ used For multi line Comment


Variable : 
Variables are containers of data. Variables are used to store data in a memory location.

To declare a variable we used Var, let  and const
For a variable that changes at a different time, we use let. If the data does not change at all, we use const. 
For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use const. We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way 
of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough.

A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:

A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number.
A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention.
A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words.
Like below
firstName
lastName
country
city
capitalCity
age
isMarried

first_name
last_name
is_married
capital_city

num1
num_1
_num_1
$num1
year2020
year_2020

THERE IS SOME OF THE EXAMPLE OF INVALID Variable
  first-name
  1_num
  num_#_1


  Syntax for varible declarition
  // Syntax
let nameOfVariable = value


Example of declared variable 
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person
let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person
let country = 'Finland' // country
let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city
let age = 100 // age in years
let isMarried = true

console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried)

// Declaring variables with number values
let age = 100 // age in years
const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity  in m/s2
const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in Â°C
const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant
console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI)

// Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma
let name = 'Asabeneh', // name of a person
job = 'teacher',
live = 'Finland'
console.log(name, job, live)
